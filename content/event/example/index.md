summary: A discussion of vector-boson scattering at the LHC.
abstract: Vector-boson scattering (VBS) processes have just started to be measured at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This is particularly exciting because this class of processes has been thought to be a possible window to new physics. But VBS is also interesting in its own right because it probes the Standard Model in extreme phase-space regions at high energy. The measurement of such processes is particularly challenging due to their low rates and large background. In this talk, I review necessary theoretical inputs to perform such measurements.
