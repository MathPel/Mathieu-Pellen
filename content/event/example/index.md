summary: A discussion of physics opportunities in W+j production at the LHC.
abstract: The production of a W boson in association with a jet possesses one of the best measured cross sections at the LHC. Despite being a standard candle, this process can still be used to learn about new aspects of the Standard Model. In this talk, I give two examples with W+charm production which gives access to the strange-quark content of the proton and polarised W+j prediction which helps unravelling the electroweak structure of the Standard Model.
