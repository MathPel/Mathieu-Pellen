summary: A discussion of W+c production at the LHC from a theoretical perspective.
abstract: W+c production at the LHC is a key process to determine precisely the strange-quark content of the proton. To that end, precise theoretical predictions comparable with experimental data are required. In this presentation, I will give an overview of the theoretical ingredients needed to preform such a comparison. In particular, I will discuss fixed-order corrections of QCD and EW type, jet algorithms, and various definitions of the process. With upcoming precise experimental data, all these aspects should be perfectly understood in order to make reliable statements on the strange-quark content of the proton.
